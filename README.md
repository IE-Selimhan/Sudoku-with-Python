# Sudoku-with-Python
Python implementation of Sudoku using PyGame

This repository is WIP (work in progress). Contributions are much appreciated.

main.py includes (at the moment..):

-insert() for entering values on the grid.
-solverMethod() for computer to create a solution of the Sudoku using backtracking.
-solve() for finishing the grid.

What is missing(!):
- Opening menu and buttons for both control and entry
- Check mechanism for the players solution is true or not
